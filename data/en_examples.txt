 And the source was a man, an African-American man, charming, rugged, homeless, playing a violin that only had two strings. 
 I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall. 
 He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies, and came backstage and introduced himself. 
 And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke, and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. 
 So, I just started playing. 
 And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. 
 And as I played, I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. 
 And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding, a quiet curiosity and grace. 
 Music is medicine. Music changes us. 
 And for Nathaniel, music is sanity. 
 And that is an escape from his tormented state. 
 And I understood that this was the very essence of art. 
 And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us, inspires and unites us. 
 And for Nathaniel, music brought him back into a fold of friends. 
 Thank you. 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks. 
 Robert Gupta. 
 Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. 
 So, please forgive me. 
 So, I've known a lot of fish in my life. 
 I've loved only two. 
 That first one, it was more like a passionate affair. 
 It was a beautiful fish: flavorful, textured, meaty, a bestseller on the menu. 
 What a fish. 
 Even better, it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. 
 So you could feel good about selling it. 
 I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. 
 One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability. 
 "Absolutely," I said. 
 For the past 50 years, we've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests. 
 It's hard to overstate the destruction. 
 Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love -- the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish -- they've collapsed. 
 There's almost nothing left. 
 So, for better or for worse, aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future. 
 It's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one. 
 That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. 
 Not very sustainable. 
 It doesn't taste very good either. 
 So here, finally, was a company trying to do it right. 
 I wanted to support them. 
 The day before the event, I called the head of P.R. for the company. 
 Let's call him Don. 
 "That's right," he said. "We're so far out, the waste from our fish gets distributed, not concentrated." 
 And then he added, "We're basically a world unto ourselves. 
 That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said. 
 "Best in the business." 
 2.5 to one, great. 
 "2.5 what? What are you feeding?" 
 "Sustainable proteins," he said. 
 "Great," I said. Got off the phone. 
 And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought: What the hell is a sustainable protein? 
 So the next day, just before the event, I called Don. 
 I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" 
 He said he didn't know. He would ask around. 
 Let's call him Don too. 
 "Don," I said, "what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" 
 Well, he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals, and then he said chicken pellets. 
 I said, "Chicken pellets?" 
 He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin, bone meal, scraps, dried and processed into feed." 
 I said, "What percentage of your feed is chicken?" 
 Thinking, you know, two percent. 
 "Well, it's about 30 percent," he said. 
 I said, "Don, what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish?" 
 There was a long pause on the line, and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world." 
 I fell out of love with this fish. 
 No, not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two shoes foodie. 
 I actually am. 
 This second fish, it's a different kind of love story. 
 It's the romantic kind, the kind where the more you get to know your fish, you love the fish. 
 I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain. 
 A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. 
 She kind of set us up. 
 It came to the table a bright, almost shimmering, white color. 
 The chef had overcooked it. 
 Like twice over. 
 Amazingly, it was still delicious. 
 Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked? 
 I can't, but this guy can. 
 Let's call him Miguel -- actually his name is Miguel. 
 He's a biologist at Veta La Palma. 
 It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. 
 It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river. 
 Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. 
 They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. 
 They did it by draining the land. 
 They built this intricate series of canals, and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. 
 Well, they couldn't make it work, not economically. 
 And ecologically, it was a disaster. 
 It killed like 90 percent of the birds, which, for this place, is a lot of birds. 
 And so in 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. 
 What did they do? 
 They reversed the flow of water. 
 They literally flipped the switch. 
 Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in. 
 They flooded the canals. 
 The farm's incredible. 
 I mean, you've never seen anything like this. 
 I was there not long ago with Miguel. 
 He's an amazing guy, like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. 
 Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite. 
 Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. 
 And here, here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. 
 I asked him how he became such an expert on fish. 
 He said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish. 
 I'm an expert in relationships." 
 And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants. 
 It's great, but I was in love. 
 And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. 
 So I interrupted him. I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?" 
 He pointed at the algae. 
 "I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton, the relationships: It's amazing. 
 But what are your fish eating? 
 What's the feed conversion ratio?" 
 The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish. 
 The system is so healthy, it's totally self-renewing. 
 There is no feed. 
 Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals? 
 At that moment, it was as if a film director called for a set change. 
 "That's success," he said. 
 "Look at their bellies, pink. 
 They're feasting." 
 Feasting? I was totally confused. 
 I said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?" 
 "Yes," he said. 
 "We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. 
 Well, last year, this property had 600,000 birds on it, more than 250 different species. 
 It's become, today, the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe." 
 I said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm?" 
 He shook his head, no. 
 He said, "We farm extensively, not intensively. 
 This is an ecological network. 
 The flamingos eat the shrimp. 
 The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. 
 So the pinker the belly, the better the system." 
 A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary. 
 Oh, and by the way, those flamingos, they shouldn't even be there in the first place. 
 They brood in a town 150 miles away, where the soil conditions are better for building nests. 
 Every morning, they fly 150 miles into the farm. 
 And every evening, they fly 150 miles back. 
 They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A92. 
 No kidding. 
 I was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing, so I looked at Miguel. 
 Do they do that for the children?" 
 He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song. 
 He said, "No; they do it because the food's better." 
 It's that acrid, tar-like flavor. 
 I almost never cook with it. 
 Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain, it tasted not at all like fish skin. 
 It tasted sweet and clean, like you were taking a bite of the ocean. 
 I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded. 
 He said, "The skin acts like a sponge. 
 It's the last defense before anything enters the body. 
 It evolved to soak up impurities." 
 And then he added, "But our water has no impurities." 
 OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish, a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators. 
 And when it works its way through the system and leaves, the water is cleaner than when it entered. 
 The system is so healthy, it purifies the water. 
 Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic. 
 You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food, whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle. 
 What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture, one in which the food actually tastes good. 
 But for a lot people, that's a bit too radical. 
 We're not realists, us foodies; we're lovers. 
 We love farmers' markets, we love small family farms, we talk about local food, we eat organic. 
 How are you going to feed the world? 
 Can I be honest? 
 I don't love that question. 
 No, not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world. 
 One billion people will go hungry today. 
 One billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of gross inequalities in distribution, not tonnage. 
 Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years. 
 That's been the motivation, it's been the justification: it's been the business plan of American agriculture. 
 That's not a business, and it isn't agriculture. 
 Our breadbasket is threatened today, not because of diminishing supply, but because of diminishing resources. 
 Want to feed the world? 
 Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves? 
 Or better: How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself? 
 To do that, don't look at the agribusiness model for the future. 
 It's really old, and it's tired. 
 It's high on capital, chemistry and machines, and it's never produced anything really good to eat. 
 Instead, let's look to the ecological model. 
 That's the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience. 
 Look to Miguel, farmers like Miguel. 
 Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor, too. 
 And if I'm going to be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be. 
 You know, I'm okay with that, because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious. 
 Thank you. 
 So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age. 
 This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment. 
 And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges. 
 And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men. 
 And if we can do this for raw data, why not do it for content as well? 
 So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced. 
 It's all here; it's all on the web. 
 You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk. 
 With Pivot, you can drill into a decade. 
 You can drill into a particular year. 
 You can jump right into a specific issue. 
 So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue, the sports. 
 So I can step back, and expand on that. 
 And I see Greg LeMond now. 
 You're doing something that's actually a little bit different. 
 It's in between, and we think it changes the way information can be used. 
 So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy. 
 What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary. 
 I'm only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here. 
 But even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things. 
 Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia. 
 I'm going to go ahead and select government. 
 So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page. 
 It's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them. 
 And interestingly enough, Bono is also a TED Prize winner. 
 So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners. 
 And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise. 
 I'm just showing the New York Times website here. 
 So I can step back, pop right back into a specific section. 
 So I can drill into what I've done over specific time frames. 
 Here, in fact, is the state of all the demo that I just gave. 
 And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today. 
 And from these, I can drill into the web page and just launch them again. 
 So right now, in this world, we think about data as being this curse. 
 We talk about the curse of information overload. 
 We talk about drowning in data. 
 If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information. 
 And, instead of dealing just with information, we can tease out knowledge. 
 And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found. 
 So with that, I thank you. 
 I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction. 
 In high school, I took a bus to school an hour each way every day. 
 You know, I was a real science geek. 
 But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility. 
 So, that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it. 
 And I was an artist. 
 I could draw. I could paint. 
 I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook. 
 That was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow. 
 So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15. 
 But I didn't let that daunt me. 
 And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean, for another two years, until we moved to California. 
 Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination. 
 I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives. 
 And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing, and just as strong as it ever was. 
 But when I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking. 
 And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on. 
 So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together, and that made sense. 
 And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking. 
 So, you know, merging the two passions. 
 And this resulted in the first soft-surface character, CG animation that was ever in a movie. 
 You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. 
 They were seeing something magical. 
 And so that got me very excited. 
 And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art." 
 So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film, we took that much farther. 
 And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. 
 So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks. 
 Secretly, what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic." 
 And that's why I made the movie. 
 And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that. 
 But I convinced them. I said, "We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real. 
 We'll be using it in the opening of the film. 
 It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook." 
 And I talked them into funding an expedition. 
 Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality. 
 Not a movie, not HD -- for real. 
 Now, that blew my mind. 
 And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. 
 But, it struck me how much this dive, these deep dives, was like a space mission. 
 You know, where it was highly technical, and it required enormous planning. 
 And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like, living in a science fiction movie. 
 This is really cool." 
 And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration. 
 And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me. 
 So, I was completely smitten by this, and had to do more. 
 And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision. 
 And so, we started planning these expeditions. 
 And we wound up going to the Bismark, and exploring it with robotic vehicles. 
 We went back to the Titanic wreck. 
 We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic. 
 And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship, which had never been done. 
 And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship. 
 When I say, "I'm operating it," but my mind is in the vehicle. 
 I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic. 
 And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship. 
 So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience. 
 It was really, really quite profound. 
 They live in an environment of chemosynthesis. 
 They don't survive on sunlight-based system the way we do. 
 And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-Centigrade water plumes. 
 You think they can't possibly exist. 
 And this was fascinating. 
 But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep. 
 So, here we were making documentary films, but actually doing science, and actually doing space science. 
 And you know, along the way in this journey of discovery, I learned a lot. 
 I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about leadership. 
 I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions. 
 Because I had to, at a certain point, say, "What am I doing out here? 
 Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?" 
 We don't make money at these damn shows. 
 We barely break even. There is no fame in it. 
 Made all these films, made all these documentary films for a very limited audience. 
 No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing? 
 Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect. 
 And it really changed the dynamic. 
 Tremendously exciting. 
 Tremendously challenging. 
 And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period. 
 And it completely changed how I do movies. 
 So, what can we synthesize out of all this? 
 You know, what are the lessons learned? 
 Well, I think number one is curiosity. 
 It's the most powerful thing you own. 
 Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. 
 And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world. 
 I have young filmmakers come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this." 
 And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself. 
 Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself, and take risks." 
 NASA has this phrase that they like: "Failure is not an option." 
 But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith. 
 And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. 
 You have to be willing to take those risks. 
 I'm going to talk today about energy and climate. 
 And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest. 
 So, the climate changes will be terrible for them. 
 Also, the price of energy is very important to them. 
 Now, the price of energy has come down over time. 
 Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. 
 And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. 
 CO2 is warming the planet, and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one. 
 And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad. 
 I asked the top scientists on this several times: Do we really have to get down to near zero? 
 Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter? 
 And the answer is that until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to rise. 
 And so that's a big challenge. 
 This is something that has to get to zero. 
 Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year, over 26 billion tons. 
 For each American, it's about 20 tons; for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton. 
 It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. 
 And, somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. 
 It's been constantly going up. 
 So, let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero. 
 Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. 
 Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look. 
 First, we've got population. 
 The world today has 6.8 billion people. 
 That's headed up to about nine billion. 
 The second factor is the services we use. 
 This encompasses everything: the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating. 
 These are very good things: getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. 
 And it's a great thing for this number to go up. 
 And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps. 
 Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service, here finally we have some good news. 
 We have something that's not going up. 
 Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent. 
 And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero? 
 If you burn coal, no. 
 If you burn natural gas, no. 
 Almost every way we make electricity today, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2. 
 And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale, is create a new system. 
 And so, we need energy miracles. 
 Now, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible. 
 The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. 
 The Internet and its services are a miracle. 
 So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. 
 Usually, we don't have a deadline, where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. 
 Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't. 
 Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this? 
 Is there some kind of natural illustration, some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?" 
 I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos, and somehow people enjoyed that. 
 It really got them involved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitos. 
 So, with energy, all I could come up with is this. 
 I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. 
 So here we have some natural fireflies. 
 I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar. 
 Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one, but they don't really add up to much. 
 I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels. 
 Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels, either burning coal or burning natural gas. 
 Who's going to be sure? 
 This is a lot of volume. 
 So that's a tough one. 
 Next would be nuclear. 
 And then what do you do with the waste? 
 And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that. 
 People need to feel good about it. 
 So three very tough problems that might be solvable, and so, should be worked on. 
 The last three of the five, I've grouped together. 
 These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. 
 And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel -- they have some disadvantages. 
 One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. 
 Also, these are intermittent sources. 
 The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day, and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time. 
 And, finally, this storage problem. 
 It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing. 
 If you're counting on it for 100 percent, you need an incredible miracle battery. 
 Now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach? 
 Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there? 
 Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds. 
 In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people. 
 And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy." That's good. 
 And, I think, here in the TED group, we have many people who are already pursuing this. 
 Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. 
 Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach. 
 There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid. 
 It is kind of a crazy idea. 
 And, because you're burning that 99 percent, you have greatly improved cost profile. 
 You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors. 
 So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing. 
 It breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle. 
 You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. 
 In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem. 
 I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. 
 That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years. 
 So let's think: How should we measure ourselves? 
 What should our report card look like? 
 Well, let's go out to where we really need to get, and then look at the intermediate. 
 For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction. 
 That really is very important, that we get there. 
 That's super important. 
 That's a key element of making that report card. 
 So, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like? 
 Well, again, it should have the two elements. 
 There's a lot of great books that have been written about this. 
 The Al Gore book, "Our Choice" and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air." 
 There's a lot that has to come together. 
 So this is a wish. 
 It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. 
 This is the one with the greatest impact. 
 So, what do we have to do? 
 What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive? 
 We need to go for more research funding. 
 When countries get together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just discuss the CO2. 
 We need to get the message out. 
 We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue, including the steps that the government takes. 
 This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done. 
 It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. 
 I mean, you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here. 
 Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this? 
 So I'm optimistic. You know, the French and Japanese have done some work. 
 This is a variant on something that has been done. 
 So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live? 
 That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. 
 And, you know, TerraPower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that. 
 And it's best if multiple succeed, because then you could use a mix of these things. 
 We certainly need one to succeed. 
 In terms of big-scale possible game changes, is this the biggest that you're aware of out there? 
 BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. 
 It would have been, even without the environmental constraint, but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. 
 In the nuclear space, there are other innovators. 
 There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard, but maybe they say that about us. 
 If this doesn't work, then what? 
 Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable? 
 Now, that's just an insurance policy. 
 You hope you don't need to do that. 
 BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps. 
 The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. 
 Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things? 
 There are very, very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things. 
 The main problem we have here, it's kind of like AIDS. 
 You make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later. 
 The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. 
 It shouldn't take away from other things. 
 If the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive," then the rich can afford that. 
 I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. 
 The disaster is for that two billion. 
 And even Lomborg has changed. 
 His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&D getting more discussed?" 
 And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. 
 The R&D piece, it's crazy how little it's funded. 
 BG: Thank you. 
 Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge. 
 The marshmallow has to be on top. 
 And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly. 
 And so, I thought this was an interesting idea, and I incorporated it into a design workshop. 
 And it was a huge success. 
 So, normally, most people begin by orienting themselves to the task. 
 They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they jockey for power. 
 Then they spend some time planning, organizing, they sketch and they lay out spaghetti. 
 They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures. 
 They lie, they cheat, they get distracted and they produce really lame structures. 
 And it's pretty amazing. 
 So the question you want to ask is: How come? Why? What is it about them? 
 They don't spend time jockeying for power. 
 But there's another reason as well. 
 And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan, right? 
 And then they execute on it. 
 It's a crisis. 
 Sound familiar? Right. 
 Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process. 
 And with each version, kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work. 
 So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential, but let's look at how different teams perform. 
 Who does the very best? 
 Architects and engineers, thankfully. 
 Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen. 
 And why is it? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures. 
 So CEOs, a little bit better than average, but here's where it gets interesting. 
 If you put you put an executive admin. on the team, they get significantly better. 
 It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win." 
 You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?
